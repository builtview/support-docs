title: How to manage Team Members and Guests
---

Guests are able to upload photos and videos and view media uploaded by anyone in the team. 

Team Members are able to upload photos and videos, edit any media in a team and edit details of a team (i.e. Team Name, Team Tags and Team Members)

To change a member's status:

1. In the team you want to edit, click the button in the top bar that shows the number of team members. 

2. Use the drop down menu beside the member's name to change their status from team member to guest and vice versa. The option to remove people from teams is also available here.
