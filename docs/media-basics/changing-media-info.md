This should open a new page with an information and comments panel on the left of the screen. By default, the details panel should be selected. This shows you the uploader, date, team, associated project, description, tags, floorplan, and GPS Location. From this page, you are also able to download, rotate, copy, markup, share, delete, view media history and edit media contents.
