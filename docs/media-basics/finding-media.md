You can filter or search from the following metrics on desktop on your team gallery page. If used properly and set up well, filtering by tags is a great way on locating media.
-	Searching: search to see media items with a similar description
-	Tags: filter by a selection of tags with and/or options.
-	Uploaders: search based on the member that uploaded in your team
-	Date: Limit your search to a date range
-	Sort by: Changing the sorting of media by newest or oldest first.
-	Type: search through media by the type, either photo, video, 360 photo or 360 video.
-	Deleted Media: find deleted media.
