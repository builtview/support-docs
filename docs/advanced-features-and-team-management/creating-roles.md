description: How to set up specific roles with granular permissions within your team

BuiltView allows you to create custom roles with specific permissions for each user. This allows you to control who can access certain features within your project and ensures that everyone has the right level of access to complete their tasks.

Using the custom role feature, you can add restrictions to specific users within the team, or limit particular actions for everyone. For example, if you don't want anyone in the team to be able to create custom tags (outside the approved Team Tags list), you can create a custom role with all permissions allowed except the option to create custom tags.

## Creating Custom Roles

Follow the steps below to create a custom role.

### Conclusion

Once you click ‘create role’ you can start assigning it to users! To do this go back to the members page, at the top you should see a list of all users apart of the team. Click on the user’s current role and switch it to the new role.
