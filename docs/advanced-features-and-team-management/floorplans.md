# Floorplans

The floorplan feature in BuiltView is designed to help you localise your visual data in situations where GPS is unusable or insufficient - for example, when working underground or on multi-level vertical builds.

You can upload floorplans to any team if you have sufficient permissions, and each team can have multiple floorplans, so you can have a separate file for each level of a building for example.
Currently, floorplans are supported as image files or as PDF files - in the latter case, only the first page of the PDF will be used to render the floorplan image.

Media items can then be allocated to specific locations on particular floorplans, and you can view your photos in the same way as you can on a map using GPS locations.
