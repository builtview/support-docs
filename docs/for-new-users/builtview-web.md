## Sorting and Sharing

Through filters such as tags, date of capture, content type, and the uploader. The files on a team, in your private files, or all files can be sorted, searched, and downloaded. This makes the arduous task of documentation & content management efficient & effective. The multi-select button makes the collation of content & downloading of large groups of items easy. So that files & content can then be saved on project servers if needed, though BuiltView stores all data on long-term enterprising platforms meaning it's there forever!

You can also change how media is displayed, by default Gallery is selected, but you can also view your media in a list, on a map or on a floorplan if you have added one.

## Reports

You can quickly make neat daily site reports as presentations for clients. Builtview’s smart and customisable report feature can be accessed once you have selected multiple media items within a team, showing the option to ‘Export’ where you can customise the type of report and what is included. To learn more about this check out the [Report and Exports](https://?) article in the Media Basics collection.
