description: What is BuiltView and why incorporate it into your work flow?

_An effective & efficient construction team relies heavily upon good quality, well-kept & easily accessible documentation. It is understood that every week approximately 6,000 photos are taken daily, of these only 1,500 are saved & shared onto project servers, therefore 75% of photos are not accessible. BuiltView addresses this problem by automating the tedious process of uploading, organising & saving content and also allows users to add more context & detail to their photos and videos. Freeing up the precious time of site teams and ensuring that the documentation process is stress-free._

**BuiltView is the dedicated camera app for construction teams.**

BuiltView has been developed with input from active site teams to ensure it caters to & keeps up with the demands that construction teams face when capturing, sharing & managing onsite content.

The app is designed to replace your phone camera, to capture and document onsite activities which are automatically uploaded to [BuiltView.com](https://app.builtview.com/) and can be shared with your selected work teams.
