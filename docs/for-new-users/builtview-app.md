These functions include:

* **Tags**; short phrases attached to content that can be used to sort & filter.
* **Description**; tell the story of the image through a few words.
* **Location**; capture the exact place the content was captured.
* **Timestamp**; watermarked on the image, the exact time of capture, approx. street address, GPS coordinates, direction.
* **Teams**; share directly with your teammates.
