# Overlaying KML files on Map View

Constructions sites are very dynamic, with conditions onsite everchanging. Therefore as conditions change it can be difficult to keep track and visualise important elements of the site or scopes. 

With KML files the consistency of key site aspects such as underground services, overhead wiring, scope drawings, or design plans, etc can be captured & displayed alongside locations of content. Providing that extra piece of information & insight when viewing, sharing & managing all of your personal & team content in BuiltView. 

To add this additional context to your map view within a team or to individual files, go to the manage map function.
