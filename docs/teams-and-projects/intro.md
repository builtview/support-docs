# Intro to Teams and Projects

Teams are a great way to organise and store your onsite photos for effective record management. Based on the size of your site project you can separate your site progression in stages or different sections with teams. You can connect these teams in a project, making it easy to see onsite progress across multiple teams.

### Conclusion

This team will now be linked to your project. All users in your project will be able to join or leave this team and data will be connected to your project dashboard.

When you are creating a new team, you can link it straight away to a project. Read the article [Creating a team](https://support.builtview.com/teams-and-projects/creating-team) to learn how.
