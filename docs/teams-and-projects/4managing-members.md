4)	User roles and permissions

You can also view the roles apart of your team. If you are a member, you can change the role permissions or create new roles. <em>This is not recommended as it can impacts the quality of your record keeping if permissions are not set correctly.</em> To learn more about user permissions and creating new roles check out the [Creating new user roles](https://support.builtview.com/team-management-and-advanced-features/creating-roles) article.
