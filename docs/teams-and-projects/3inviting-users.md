You have the option to invite users by email, other teams you are apart of, link, QR code or .txt file.

- **Email**: enter the email addresses of the user’s you want to invite to your team and select a role. You can also include an invite message!
- **Teams**: Invite all users that are in a team you are also apart of and select an initial role for them. You can also include an invite message.
- **Link**: Select a role and copy the invite link or generate a QR code to send to your users
- **.Txt file**: As a way to invite a large number of users to a team, you can do this with a .txt file, if formatted correctly “email,role.” You can also include an invite message!
